# Hi I'm Christine!ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸŽ“ Currently a Sophomore at UMass Lowell, studying Computer Science - hoping to concentrate on Data Science and use my skills to help the climate

I'm always open to learning new things and learning more about the world through data analysis, and using that data for machine learning. To learn more, I'm currently a fellow at Break Through Tech AI and improving my technical skills through the coursework. At this moment, I'd like to grow my skills in a professional setting and collaborate with others on industry projects. <br/>

## ðŸ›  Technical Skills:
Programming Languages: C, Python, Java (basic) <br/>
Libraries & Frameworks: scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib <br/>
Development Tools: Jupyter Notebooks <br/>

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Project: https://github.com/ChristineHur/lab8-solve-ml-problem
Using a dataset about AirBnB listings, I tried creating a gradient boosted decision tree model to predict review scores ratings so that higher rated listings could be predicted. In this project, I used python and scikit-learn to first preprocess the data, then create the model and evaluate the model using R^2 and RMSE scores.


## âš¡ Fun fact:
Boba is an addiction that keeps me going and gives me the energy to code, show up, and learn!
