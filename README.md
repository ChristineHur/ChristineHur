## Hi I'm Christine!ðŸ‘‹

# ðŸŽ“ Currently a Sophomore at UMass Lowell, studying Computer Science - hoping to concentrate on Data Science and use my skills to help the climate

I'm always open to learning new things and learning more about the world through data analysis, and using that data for machine learning. To learn more, I'm currently a fellow at Break Through Tech AI and am improving my technical skill. At this moment, I'd like to grow my skills in a professional setting and collaborate with others on industry projects.
